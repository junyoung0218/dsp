[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> Based on the Cohen's d calculated for the totalwgt_lb for first and other babies, we can say that first babies tend to be slightly lighter than that of other babies(cohen's d = -0.0886). The Cohen's d calculated for prglngth is 0.0288, which by this shows that prglngth for first babies are longer than that of other babies.
